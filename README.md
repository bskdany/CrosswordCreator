# crossword-creator
a python script that places given words in a crossword

how to use:
You need to have python and an editor like vscode to run it.
You can setup the words you need in the config.py file
as well as the size of the crossword and how many of them
do you want.
This program is pretty heavy, sometimes you'll need a lot 
of time to create a single crossword.
