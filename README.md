#CrosswordCreator
A program that places given words in a crossword.
Initially developed in Python and then integrated on a website with Brython.<br />
This was meant as a school project.<br />

The new website is online and pubblically avaiable at https://cr0sswordcreator.000webhostapp.com//<br />

The old webssite wah shutdown due to too much traffic. Enjoy
